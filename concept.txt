Abnormal Energy Consumption Pattern Detection for Smart Grids Using Fusion Matrix with Improved Clustering Algorithms 

ABSTRACT The rapid development of smart grids has increased the demand for effective methods to detect abnormal electricity consumption 
patterns, which are critical for ensuring grid reliability, reducing energy waste, and preventing risks such as fraud and equipment failures. 
This study proposes a hybrid framework combining Fusion Matrix Completion and advanced clustering techniques to address the challenges 
of incomplete, noisy, and unbalanced energy consumption data. Fusion Matrix Completion will be used to reconstruct incomplete datasets, 
providing a solid foundation for anomaly detection. The framework integrates clustering methods such as DBSCAN for density-based outlier
detection, Hierarchical Clustering to uncover hidden structures in the data, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for probabilistic
modeling of overlapping clusters. By leveraging the strengths of these techniques, the proposed approach aims to effectively detect both
subtle and extreme anomalies in real-world smart grid datasets. This research seeks to develop a scalable and efficient solution for energy 
providers to monitor consumption patterns, enhance grid management, and ensure energy security in modern smart grid systems.
